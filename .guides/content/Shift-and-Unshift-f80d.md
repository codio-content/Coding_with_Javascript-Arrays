There are also has a couple of useful methods for adding elements to the start of an array.

{Run code}(node ./content/1-arrays/shift-unshift.js)

## Unshift
`array.push(newElement)` is an often used way of adding a new element to the end of an array. Think "we are pushing a new element onto the end of the array".

## Shift
`array.pop()` removes the last element from the array. Think "we are popping an element off the end of the array".

Run the code and check you understand what is happening.
