Unshift and shift are also useful methods for adding or removing elements. Where push and pop add and remove elements at the *end* of an array, unshift and shift add and remove elements at the *beginning*.

{Run code}(node ./content/1-arrays/shift-unshift.js)

## Unshift
`values.unshift(newElement)` is used to add a new element at the start of an array.

## Shift
`values.shift()` is used to remove the first element at the beginning of an array. 

Run the code to check you understand what is happening.
