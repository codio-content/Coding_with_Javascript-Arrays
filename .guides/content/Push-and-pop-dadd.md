JavaScript has a couple of useful methods for adding elements to the end of an array. They are called push and pop!

{Run code}(node ./content/1-arrays/push-pop.js)

## Push
`values.push(newElement)` is used to add a new element to the end of an array. Imagine it as "we are pushing a new element on the end of the array".

## Pop
`values.pop()` is used to remove the last element from the array. Imagine it as "we are popping an element off the end of the array".

Run the code to check you understand what is happening.
