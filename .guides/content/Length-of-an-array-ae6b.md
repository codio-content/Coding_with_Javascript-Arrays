One important thing you will need to know about arrays is the number of elements an array has.

{Run the code on the left}(node ./content/length-example.js)

If you look at the code on the left, you will see the following

```javascript
6  var arrayLength= numbers.length
```

This returns the number of elements in the array `numbers`. 

You will often use this in loops so you can loop through all the elements in an array.
