You have already studied arrays in the Flode arrays unit, so you should be familiar with the concept of arrays. (If you haven't completed the Flode unit, we recommend that you do. It is available in the `An Introduction to Programming > Flode` course).

## Creating arrays
Array creation in JavaScript works in exactly the same way as in Flode. 

### String arrays
You create a string array like this:

```javascript
strArray = [ 'Alice', 'Shahneila', 'Bob, 'Tariq' ]
```

### Number arrays
Here is an example of a number array:

```javascript
numArray = [1, 3.141, 5, 17.1, 100]
```

### Empty array
If you are going to create your own array then you need to create an empty array variable before you add any data to it.

The correct way to create an empty array variable is as follows:

```javascript
numArray = []
numArray[0] = 4
```

Note: the following example will fail because the array has not already been created:

```javascript
numArray[0] = 4
```
